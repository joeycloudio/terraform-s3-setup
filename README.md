# Create S3 Buckets with Terraform  
**Automating Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to use **Terraform** to automate the creation of **S3 buckets** in AWS.  
Terraform is a popular **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool that allows engineers to define and manage infrastructure in a consistent, scalable way.  

### **🎯 Key Takeaways:**  
- **Terraform Basics** – Installed and configured Terraform to interact with AWS.  
- **Infrastructure Automation** – Used Terraform to create an **S3 bucket** and define its properties.  
- **AWS CLI Integration** – Leveraged AWS CLI to authenticate and manage resources.  
- **Terraform Commands** – Used `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` for deployment.

## **⚙ Tools & Technologies**  
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
- **Amazon S3** – Cloud Object Storage  
- **AWS CLI** – Command-line interaction with AWS

## **🔧 Project Implementation**  

### **1️⃣ Configuring the Terraform Script**  
- Defined the **cloud provider** (AWS) in the `main.tf` file.  
- Provisioned an **S3 bucket** with custom properties.  
- Managed **bucket policies and ACLs** for security.  

### **2️⃣ Initializing & Deploying the Infrastructure**  
- Ran `terraform init` to initialize Terraform and download AWS provider plugins.  
- Used `terraform plan` to preview infrastructure changes before deployment.  
- Executed `terraform apply` to provision the S3 bucket and its configurations.  

### **3️⃣ Uploading an Object to S3**  
- Modified the Terraform script to include an **S3 object upload**.  
- Re-ran `terraform apply` to update the infrastructure and verify the upload.
